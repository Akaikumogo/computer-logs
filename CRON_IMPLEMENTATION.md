# Cron Job Implementation for Automatic Warning System

## Problem

The cron job system was not working properly. People who were still working after 12:00 PM were not being marked with warnings or any status updates.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed ScheduleModule Configuration

- Added `@nestjs/schedule` import to `AppModule`
- Added `NestScheduleModule.forRoot()` to enable cron job functionality
- The issue was that the ScheduleModule from `@nestjs/schedule` was not imported

### 2. Created CronService (`src/schedule/cron.service.ts`)

This service contains three automated cron jobs:

#### A. Daily Warning at 12:00 PM

```typescript
@Cron('0 12 * * *', {
  name: 'mark-active-employees-warning',
  timeZone: 'Asia/Tashkent',
})
```

- Runs every day at 12:00 PM
- Finds employees who checked in but haven't checked out
- Marks them with `hasWarning: true`
- Sets warning reason: "Ish vaqti tugaganidan keyin ham ishlamoqda"

#### B. Overtime Warning at 18:00 PM

```typescript
@Cron('0 18 * * *', {
  name: 'mark-overtime-employees-warning',
  timeZone: 'Asia/Tashkent',
})
```

- Runs every day at 18:00 PM
- Finds employees still working after 18:00
- Marks them with overtime warning
- Sets warning reason: "Overtime ishlamoqda - 18:00 dan keyin ham ishlamoqda"

#### C. Auto Checkout at 23:59

```typescript
@Cron('59 23 * * *', {
  name: 'auto-checkout-employees',
  timeZone: 'Asia/Tashkent',
})
```

- Runs every day at 23:59
- Automatically creates checkout records for employees still working
- Prevents employees from staying "active" overnight
- Sets device as "AUTO_SYSTEM" and adds warning

### 3. Manual Warning System

Added a manual endpoint for testing and immediate warning application:

#### Controller Endpoint

```typescript
@Post('attendance/manual-warning')
async manuallyMarkActiveEmployeesWarning()
```

#### Service Method

```typescript
async manuallyMarkActiveEmployeesWarning()
```

### 4. Updated ScheduleModule

- Added `CronService` to providers and exports
- Ensures cron jobs are properly registered

## How It Works

### Database Schema

The system uses the existing `Attendance` schema with these warning fields:

- `hasWarning: boolean` - Indicates if the attendance has a warning
- `warningReason: string` - Description of the warning
- `warningTimestamp: Date` - When the warning was applied

### Logic Flow

1. **Check-in**: Employee checks in normally
2. **12:00 PM**: Cron job runs, marks active employees with warning
3. **18:00 PM**: Cron job runs, marks overtime employees with warning
4. **23:59 PM**: Cron job runs, auto-checks out remaining employees

### Manual Testing

You can test the system immediately using:

```bash
POST /schedule/attendance/manual-warning
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:

1. `src/app.module.ts` - Added NestScheduleModule
2. `src/schedule/schedule.module.ts` - Added CronService
3. `src/schedule/schedule.service.ts` - Added manual warning method
4. `src/schedule/schedule.controller.ts` - Added manual warning endpoint

### New Files:

1. `src/schedule/cron.service.ts` - Main cron job service
2. `test-cron.js` - Test script for manual testing
3. `CRON_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

## Testing

### Automatic Testing

The cron jobs will run automatically at:

- 12:00 PM (Asia/Tashkent timezone)
- 18:00 PM (Asia/Tashkent timezone)
- 23:59 PM (Asia/Tashkent timezone)

### Manual Testing

1. Start the server: `npm run start:dev`
2. Get a JWT token from login
3. Update `test-cron.js` with your token
4. Run: `node test-cron.js`

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Warning System**: No manual intervention needed
2. **Multiple Warning Levels**: 12:00 PM and 18:00 PM warnings
3. **Auto Checkout**: Prevents overnight "active" status
4. **Manual Override**: Can trigger warnings immediately for testing
5. **Proper Timezone**: Uses Asia/Tashkent timezone
6. **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions are logged for monitoring

## Monitoring

Check the server logs for cron job execution:

```
üîÑ Starting cron job: Mark active employees with warning at 12:00 PM
üìä Found X employees still active at 12:00 PM
‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning added for employee X - still active after 12:00 PM
‚úÖ Cron job completed: X employees marked with warning
```

The system is now fully functional and will automatically handle employee status updates throughout the day.
